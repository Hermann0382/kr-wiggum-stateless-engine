# Test Project Brainstorm

## What I want to build

I want a simple utility that converts markdown files to HTML.

The user should be able to:
- Run a command with an input file path
- Get an HTML output file in the same directory
- Support basic markdown: headers, bold, italic, lists, code blocks

## Technical requirements

- Should be a Node.js CLI tool
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Include tests with Vitest
- Follow the existing code patterns in the project

## Nice to have

- Support for tables
- Syntax highlighting in code blocks
- Custom CSS styling option
